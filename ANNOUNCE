DFM - The Desktop-File-Manager for X11
======================================

Version 0.9.1

DFM is a desktopmanager for linux and other UNIX-OS. Files are shown 
as icons and every folder has it's own window. The desktopbackground 
is a special folder in the homedirectory.

The idea is to write a filemanager like the OS/2 WPS.

Here are some features:

* icons may have any size and position 
* show XVPICS as icons
* save icon and window info
* iconname to cutbuffer (paste to xterm, ...)
* "Constant position" icons that cannot be moved (or arranged)
* easy adding new programs to the desktop
* ...

New since beta-4
* Offix DND support
* close dfm window while open a icon (SHIFT)
* new color selector
* able to stop copying procedure ("Stop" button)
* enlightenment now works
* "Arrange" now works correct
* Some hotkeys
* better structure view
* SHIFT now copies the position of the parent window
* bugfixes

You need

c-compiler, xforms >= 0.86, libXpm >= 4.7, libXext(XShapeExtension), X11, 
16MB and a windowmanager
