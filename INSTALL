How to COMPILE and INSTALL DFM:
===============================

You need: a c-compiler, xforms, libXpm, libXext, X11

In order to COMPILE make sure, that you are in the top of the DFM-hierarchy.
Now type:

>./config
>make

It should compile under Linux, SunOS and IRIX.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The INSTALLationprocedure is also simple. Choose one of the following ways:

- If you are *updating* from alpha-6 or later simply copy the "dfm" binary 
  to your bin path.

These ways will delete your previous dfm-library directory:

- If you want to install DFM in "/usr/local/bin/" and "/usr/local/share/"
  type the following (as root):

  >make install

- If you want to install DFM in "/usr/X11/bin/" and "/usr/share/"
  type the following (as root):

  >make install_dist

- You may install dfm manually: Copy "dfm" to a binary-directory.
  Copy "lib" to a folder you want to (you may change the name).
  Copy "extentions/dfmext_normal" to "~/.dfmext", "/etc/dfmext",
  "/usr/etc/dfmext" or "/usr/local/etc/dfmext". Edit the dfmext file
  according to the icons in the "lib" folder.

- If you are an normal user make sure that "~/bin" is in your path and
  exist. Also make sure that you are in "~/dfm" !!! After the installation 
  don't delete the "~/dfm" folder !!! Type the following (as user):

  >make install_user

Well done!!! Now read the "START" file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to UNINSTALL DFM:
=====================

Choose your way:

- If you want to delete the DFM installation as normal user type the
  following:

  >make uninstall_user

  after that delete manually ".dfmdesk/", ".dfminfo" and ".dfmext"

- If you want to delete DFM as root type:

  >make uninstall

  This will delete all folders and files in all possible installationpaths.
