How to start DFM:
=================

There are many ways to start DFM. For example by using the ".xinitrc" file, 
the ".xsession" file, the initfile of the windowmanager or last but not least
by directly executing in a xterm. The last one is shown here:

1. Start X11 (with a windowmanager)
2. Open a new "xterm"
3. Type:
   >dfm
4. The DFM-desktop appears with two or more icons in the 
   upper-left corner of the screen. The context of the 
   windowmanager is available in the last line of the screen
   or by first pressing the middle mouse key.
5. Have Fun!!! :-)
